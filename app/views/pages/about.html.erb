<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Dustin Rath. My wife, Boseon Rath, has been working within the food and beverage industry for several years. She made a comment to me some time ago, "huny, it sure would be nice to have a place to easily share my ideas with other wine lovers on the fly!" I took that comment and decided to put pen to paper.  I have to agree with her, after doing some research, I realized that it would be nice for individuals in the F&B world to have easy access to an online resource where they may share quick pictures and comments for review after their shift! Not only can this lead to paperless note taking, but also the diversification of ideas from others! Imagine a guest whom decides to visit your restaurant, we see it all the time, they take out their phones and snap a quick picture of their meal!  If you spot this on the job, why not take a picture of that entree, along with the drink selection they chose for their meal.  This could lead to stronger menu structuring! I hope you find this application to be entertaining and helpful in your career! If you have any suggestions please feel free to drop me an email - rathd@unlv.nevada.edu  </p>
